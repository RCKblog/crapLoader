The goal of crapLoader is to loads ads, widgets or any javascript-code with document.write in it. The recommended solution is to use iframes for third-party content, but this is not always possible. Normally document.write prevents you from loading a script asynchronously, but this lib hijacks document.write and delegates the content loaded from each script into the correct position. Not ready for testing yet... and certainly not for production!
